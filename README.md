# cpp-examples

A collection of simple and easy to understand C++17 code examples for beginners to learn from!

Note that these do **not** use `using namespace std;`, so there are `std::` littered all over the code. This is proper professional C++ style and beginners should familiarize themselves with this aesthetic, so its kept in.

In order of increasing complexity:

0. [hello_world](https://github.com/lionkor/cpp-examples/blob/master/hello_world.cpp)

1. [hello_name](https://github.com/lionkor/cpp-examples/blob/master/hello_name.cpp)

2. [hello_name_and_age](https://github.com/lionkor/cpp-examples/blob/master/hello_name_and_age.cpp)

3. [age_child_or_adult](https://github.com/lionkor/cpp-examples/blob/master/age_child_or_adult.cpp)

4. [age_child_or_adult_2](https://github.com/lionkor/cpp-examples/blob/master/age_child_or_adult_2.cpp)

5. [sum_values](https://github.com/lionkor/cpp-examples/blob/master/sum_values.cpp)
